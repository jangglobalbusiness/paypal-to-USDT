# upwork

Hi There<br>
Thanks for applying to this job.<br>
I am Jang, I would discuss an opportunity with you.<br>
I saw you don't use upwork account mostly, so I would use your upwork account using Anydesk, Teamviewer or something else.<br>
I don't need anything for account information, I just want to use your account through remote tools, send proposal and get jobs, then we will share the profit with you. The profit rate will be 20% of the withdraw funds from upwork.
But there is a requirement. When I try to get jobs, clients want to call for interview, I want you pass the interview, then I will manage everything, Let's build longterm partnership.
Please let me know what you think.
My email is just jangglobalbusiness@gmail.com<br>
My skype: live:.cid.68ba25766be7fefe

Thank you
Jang
